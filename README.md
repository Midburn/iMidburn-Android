## Installation

* Make sure your Android SDK packages are up to date.
* `$ git clone https://github.com/yuvalbl/iBurn-Android --recursive`
* `$ cd ./iBurn-Android`
* `$ touch ./iBurn/src/main/java/com/gaiagps/iburn/SECRETS.java && open ./iBurn/src/main/java/com/gaiagps/iburn/SECRETS.java`
* Copy the following into SECRETS.java:

    ```java
    package com.gaiagps.iburn;

    public class SECRETS {

        public static final String HOCKEY_ID = "YOUR_HOCKEYAPP_ID";
        public static final String UNLOCK_CODE = "WHATEVER";
        public static final String IBURN_API_URL = "SOME_URL";

    }
    ```
* `$ ./gradlew assembleDebug` or from Android Studio invoke 'Import Project' and select the `./iBurn-Android` directory.
* update gradle script for module: `android-gmaps-addons` - change the following in build.gradle:
    in `defaultConfig` change `minSdkVersion` from  9 to 14

**Note**: Camp, Art and Event location data (`camps.json`, `art.json`, `events.json`) are embargoed by the Burning Man Organization until the gates open each year. Sorry!

Fortunately, you can still run and test the app with the previous year's data.

## TODO

* When searching map, smooth zoom to frame results
* Pretty up that item detail view.
* Show Favorites on the Map
* Scroll back to top when switching sort
* Put Playa location as first item in detail view (e.g. 7:45 & E)
* Put distance as second item in detail view
* Put description as third item in detail view
* Make map view on detail screen slightly smaller
* Show Playa location below camp/art relation link on Events detail view


## Updating data
If bundled tiles are updated, you can change MapProvider.MBTILE_DESTINATION to force all upgrades to copy the bundled tiles.

Put bundled database in `./iBurn/main/assets/databases`, make sure DBWrapper filename is up to date, and bump version to force a dump-and-recopy.

## Releasing
Make sure you've:

+ Set embargo date correctly in `Embargo.java`, and adjust dates in `AdapterUtils`
+ Incremented the version code and name in ./iBurn/build.grade
The final pre-signed store release should be built with:

    $ ./gradlew assembleRegularUnsigned

Pass the resulting apk off for signing. Then zipalign before publishing:

    $ zipalign -f -v 4 ./signed.apk ./signed-aligned.apk
